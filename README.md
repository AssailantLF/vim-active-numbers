## ActiveNumbers

Only show line numbers in the active window.

Clear the clutter of line numbers outside the current window.  Line numbers
usually aren't relevant outside of the current file, anyway. This can also help
indicate which window is active.

### Basic Usage

Works out of the boxâ„¢, and will follow however you have the `'number'` and
`'relativenumber'` options set.

These are usually set in your vimrc:

    set number relativenumber

Alternatively you can set the globals to be more explicit:

    let g:active_number = 1
    let g:active_relativenumber = 1

### Functions

**1. Change the appearance of active line numbers:**

    :SetActiveNumbers {option(s)}

Works just like normal `:set`, but also updates the plugin.

Example: `:SetActiveNumbers rnu!` to toggle relative numbers.

**2. Enable, Disable, or Toggle the plugin entirely:**

    :ActiveNumbers on
    :ActiveNumbers off
    :ActiveNumbers {no-arguments} = toggle

**3. Ignore the current window:**

    :ActiveNumbersIgnore  = window ignored by ActiveNumbers
    :ActiveNumbersIgnore! = window acknowledged by ActiveNumbers

Example: `:ActiveNumbersIgnore | set nu nornu` to have persistent, non-relative
line numbers in the current window.

Another example: `:tabdo windo ActiveNumbersIgnore!` to stop ignoring all windows.

### Excluded Filetypes

Some plugins and filetypes don't need line numbers. Here are the filetypes
ignored by default:

    let g:actnum_exclude =
          \ [ 'unite', 'tagbar', 'startify', 'undotree', 'gundo', 'vimshell', 'w3m' ]

In order to add more to the list, just put a superset of the above in your
vimrc. (Or include a subset if you like micro-optimization :P)
